## How to Run OpenAI Skincare Routine Generation Tests

There are two ways to run the OpenAI tests:

### 1. From Xcode:

1. Open the GlowPlan project in Xcode
2. Run the app in the iOS simulator
3. Check the Xcode console for test results

### 2. From Command Line:

You can run the test directly from the command line using Swift:

```bash
# Navigate to the project directory
cd /path/to/GlowPlan

# Run the test script
swift RunOpenAITest.swift
```

### Viewing Results:

The test will display:
- Morning routine steps with products
- Evening routine steps with products
- Verification that SPF is included in morning routine (if requested)
- Verification that double cleanse is included in evening routine (if requested)

### Custom Testing:

You can also modify the test parameters in `OpenAITest.swift` in the `testCustomRules()` function to try different skin profiles.

The current test profile is configured with:
- Skin Type: Combination
- Concerns: Dryness
- Sensitivity: Slightly sensitive
- SPF: Yes
- Double Cleanse: Yes
- Climate: Dry
- Preferred Ingredients: Hyaluronic Acid, Niacinamide, Vitamin C
- Allergies: Essential Oils, Lavender

### Note About the API Key:

The API key is configured in `OpenAI-Config.swift`. Please ensure you rotate (change) this key after testing, as it was included in plaintext in the code.
